GUI written in Python to parse OSM (OpenStreetMap) files and render them onscreen. Layers may be toggled on/off and drawing may be customized.

This program allows a user to render OSM files within the GUI. The GUI enables the user to easily modify which layers are visible and the style of these layers.
